# PureRGB-edited 

Slight edits to Vortyne's fantastic ROMhack: PureRGB. I'm mainly changing front sprites for some mons

![front sprite replacements](/screenshots/front_sprite_replacements.png?raw=true)

Sprites that could be changed in the menu screen can still be changed to their alts, but they've been relabeled

other changes
- Gyarados is now Water/Dragon
- Charizard is now Fire/Dragon
- Gastly/Haunter/Gengar are solely Ghost types
- Ekans no longer learns smog
- Doduo/Dodrio can't learn the HM Fly
